#About me
Very passionate about the Big Data and related Technologies, especially Spark and Scala, but not limited to.

I love Artificial Intelligence and the languages both artificial and natural.

When I was student my principal projects were: 

1.- A software which resolve economic engineering problems from a text given in natural language

2.- The creation of a language and compiler to automatize devices using the parallel port of the pc. It generated C code.

I'm always happy to participate in Big Data Projects
